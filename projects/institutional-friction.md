**Status:** Preparing for Journal Submission & PhD Proposal | **Methodology:** Mixed-Methods

## Research Puzzle

Why do pro-efficiency state "rescaling" reforms (e.g., administrative consolidation) often lead to policy implementation delays and severe burnout among street-level bureaucrats in township industrial parks?

## Core Argument

I propose that the root cause lies in the **"institutional friction"** generated by the interaction between macro-level institutional designs and micro-level individual actors. This concept provides an integrated framework for systematically explaining grassroots governance dilemmas.

## Theoretical Contribution

- **Extending Downward:** Expanding Neil Brenner's scale theory to include individual actors at the end of the governance chain.
- **Contextualizing Upward:** Grounding burnout research within its institutional and spatial context.
- **Building Bridges:** Creating theoretical links between macro-institutional analysis and micro-psychological mechanisms.

## Research Foundation & Methods

- **Theoretical Framework:** Completed systematic literature review and theoretical model.
- **Field Insights:** Deep observational understanding and empathy gained from embedded work in a Jiangsu sub-district office.
- **Data Evidence:** Collected a novel dataset of ~10,000 firm mobility records over 4 years to provide quantitative evidence for "institutional friction".
