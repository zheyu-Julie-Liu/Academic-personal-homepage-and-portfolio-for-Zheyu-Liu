# Scalar Restructuring and Grassroots Governance in China

**Status:** Journal Under-review & PhD Preparation | **Methodology:** Mixed-Methods

---

## Current & Proposed Research
During my working in urban and industrial renewal, I noticed that street-level officials often facing tough choices balancing competing goals, like the pressure to boost the economy while also meeting high environmental standards,which may narrow the scope of businesses eligible to invest locally. Pressure from this kind of dilemma often leads to outcomes that diverge from policy intentions.

I see this as a form of governance friction, a phenomenon where complex local interests and misaligned incentives dampen the willingness and capacity of street-level officials to carry out policies effectively, resulting in gaps bewteen plan and reality.
This approach connects with Dr. Wang's work through a shared focus on individual’s willing as the critical mechanism linking macro-scale forces to micro-level behaviors. In her work, she shows how external factors such as pollution or pandemic affect individual willingness to travel,which in turn shapes urban consumption patterns.She uses quantative methods to make this psychological shift visible.

I adopted a similar analytical approach to understand policy implementation. My research examines how macro-scale restructuring strategies, eg industrial upgrading, are mediated by the psychological and behavioral shifts of local officials, finaly present as governance frictions between policy intent and actual result.

## Research Question

My doctoral research aims to systematically uncover: Why and how does macro-scale restructuring policy generate friction during its grassroots implementation in China's urban regeneration, and how does this friction ultimately shape governance efficacy and physical spatial outcomes?
To achieve this, the study will be guided by the following sub-questions:
*   How does rescaling reconfigure the local state's "policy toolkit" (e.g., resource allocation, regulatory power) and its interactions with market actors?
*   How do these reconfigured governance contexts influence the decision-making logic and behavioral patterns of street-level officials?(Already discussed in the literature review paper)
*   How are these behavioral patterns ultimately materialized in the physical urban form (e.g., in land-use efficiency, the spatial distribution of industries, and the provision of public services)?

## Linking Theory to Empirical Inquiry

Based on a revision of Neil Brenner's scale-restructuring theory and its practice in China, my working paper integrated Ouyang's  “strong–weak governance” framework on county-level governance to build an analytical model, revealing that policy pressures from scale restructuring trigger a path dependence in grassroots governance，where resources continue to flow into traditionally measurable strong-governance domains, while long-term, cultivation-intensive industrial services are overlooked in practice during implementation. This established theoretical foundation allows my doctoral research to focus on the next logical step: empirically testing these mechanisms and answering the remaining questions through a rigorous mixed-methods design.


## Research Design & Methods

I propose a mixed-methods research design that leverages my strengths and aligns with Dr. Wang's expertise.

* 	### Quantitative Analysis: Identifying Patterns and Causal Effects
  
I will use my collected dataset of about 10,000 firm relocation records (2020-2025) as the core of this research. My main strategy is to apply a Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to find causal evidence. For this, I am gathering key local policy documents and official announcements about the strategic shift to advanced manufacturing. The goal is to identify a clear starting point for this policy, which will serve as a quasi-natural experiment for my analysis. The DID model will then measure the policy's net effect by comparing the migration patterns of firms targeted by the new policy against similar firms that were not targeted. Additionally, I will use available spatial data like Points of Interest (POI) to support the findings. For example, if the policy is working, we should see changes in the locations of manufacturing-related services on the map, which would visually confirm the statistical results.

* 	### Qualitative Deep-Dive: Unpacking the Mechanism

My proven skills in semi-structured interviews and embedded ethnography will be crucial to uncover the mechanisms behind the quantitative patterns. I will conduct in-depth interviews with local officials to understand their perceptions, constraints, and adaptive strategies, thereby giving human context to the statistical results.
