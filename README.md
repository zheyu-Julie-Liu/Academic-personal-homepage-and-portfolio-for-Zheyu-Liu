## Research Profile

A spatial planner and PhD applicant specializing in grassroots governance and policy implementation within China’s urban transformation. With a Master’s from Oxford Brookes University and three years of strategic consulting experience in China,experienced in turning strategy and industrial development case studies into action plan for implementers and regulators.I leverage mixed-methods research—integrating spatial analysis (GIS), computational tools (Python), and in-depth case studies—to investigate how culture, community, and institutions interact in shaping urban spaces.
My research proposal develops a mixed-methods framework to examine policy mechanisms and community dynamics in culturally-led urban regeneration, seeking to bridge data-driven analysis and qualitative insights for more effective and inclusive governance.

## Project in Work

###  [Research Proposal for: Scalar Restructuring and Grassroots Governance](./projects/institutional-friction.md)
*    **Current Stage (Manuscript Under Review):**

I have established the theoretical foundation of this project in a working paper entitled *尺度重构下的基层治理困境:县域产城更新的“强-弱治理”逻辑与破解路径*. The paper proposes the concept of "governance friction" to bridge macro-state-rescaling and micro-burnout theories, creating a novel framework to explain the paradox of policy stagnation in Chinese townships.
  
*    **Future PhD Research:**
    
My doctoral research aims to systematically uncover: Why and how does macro-scale restructuring policy generate friction during its grassroots implementation in China's urban regeneration, and how does this friction ultimately shape governance efficacy and physical spatial outcomes? The next phase of this research, outlined in my Research Statement, will involve a mixed-methods research design, which includes a 	Quantitative Analysis based on Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to find causal evidence on the relevance between policy implementation and the migration patterns of firms. This reserach would also invovle qualitative research based on semi-structured interview to uncover the mechanisms behind the quantitative patterns.
*The literature review component has been developed into a full manuscript 《尺度重构下的基层治理困境:县域产城更新的“强-弱治理”逻辑与破解路径》, currently undergoing external peer review.*
